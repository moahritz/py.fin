    "#### Simulating a stock market\n",
    "Consider a financial market consisting of one or more stock exchanges. In this market, only one asset is traded (to keep it simple). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each stock exchange operates as a limit order book. I.e., if an investor Alice submits, e.g., a buy order, she specifies the maximum price she is willing to pay (called the limit price) and the number of shares she would like to trade (we will set the number of shares to 1 for simplicity). If there already is an existing sell order in the order book (previously submitted by another trader we will call Bob) with a limit price below or equal to Alice's limit price, a trade happens at Bob's limit price. If there is no such existing order, Alice's order enters the limit order book to wait for a seller who might be willing to trade at her limit price. Assume, for simplicity and contrary to real markets, that an order cannot be cancelled or modified after it has been submitted.\n",

    "1. Implementing a limit oder market\n",
    "\n",
    "You are strongly encouraged to implement the limit order market as a class, so that you can later easily generate exchanges with slightly varying parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit order market needs to offer the following functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* access to the best bid and the best ask price (as attributes of the market or via methods)\n",
    "* processing of incoming orders, where orders have the parameters `limit_price`, `side` (i.e. buy or sell), `size` (i.e. number of shares), and an `order_id` (i.e. an integer identifying an order). Processing constitutes of \n",

    "    * returning information on whether a trade happened and, if so, return trade price, size, and the IDs of the order that traded against one another\n",
    "    \n",
    "The only parameter pertaining to the order book is the tick size, which is a measure of the granularity of the prices the exchange allows. E.g., a tick size of 0.01 means that limit prices must be numbers expressed in whole cents.     \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ if there are multiple orders that would match with the new order, the buy order with the highest limit price/sell order with the lowest limit price will trade against the new order. If multiple orders at the same price exist in the order book, the order submitted the earliest get to trade first. This rule is called price-time priority and is the most common, though not the only, rule applied in real limit order books."
