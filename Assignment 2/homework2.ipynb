    "#### Introduction to pricing plain vanilla options\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the various types of options, plain vanilla European options are the most fundamental. A European option is characterized by the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price on a specific expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Payoff Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff function for a European call option is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Payoff}_{\\text{call}} = \\max(S_T - K, 0)$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $S_T$ is the price of the underlying asset at maturity, and $K$ is the strike price. This means that if the asset price at maturity is above the strike price, the holder can purchase the asset at the strike price and realize a gain equal to the difference. If the asset price is below the strike price, the option expires worthless, and the loss is limited to the premium paid for the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the payoff function for a European put option is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Payoff}_{\\text{put}} = \\max(K - S_T, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the holder's right to sell the asset at the strike price. The put option is valuable if the asset price falls below the strike price, allowing the holder to sell the asset at a higher price than the market offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Black-Scholes Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For a non-dividend-paying asset, the Black-Scholes price of a European call option is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C(S, t) = S N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt} N(d_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the price of a European put option is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(S, t) = Ke^{-rt} N(-d_2) - S N(-d_1)$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* $C(S,t)$ and $P(S,t)$ are the call and put option prices, respectively.\n",
    "* $S$ is the current price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "* $K$ is the strike price.\n",
    "* $r$ is the risk-free interest rate.\n",
    "* $t$ is the time to expiration.\n",
    "* $N(⋅)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "* $d_1=\\frac{ln(S/K)+(r+\\sigma^2/2)t}{\\sigma\\sqrt{t}}$ and $d_2=d_1-\\sigma\\sqrt{t}$, where $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the asset's returns.\n"

    "4. We will finally consider Barrier options. Barrier options are a type of exotic option where the payoff depends on whether the underlying asset's price reaches a certain level, known as the barrier, during the option's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of barrier options: knock-in and knock-out. A knock-in option becomes active only if the price of the underlying asset crosses a certain level. By contrast, a knock-out option expires worthless if the price of the underlying asset ever crosses a certain level. The options can further be distinguished by whether the price threshold is crossed from below (Up-and-out, Up-and-in) or above (Down-and-out, Down-and-in). Each of these four types of options exist for both calls and puts, thus yielding eight different payoff functions. At maturity the payoff of a barrier option, if it is active, is identical to that of an otherwise similar plain vanilla call or put option.\n",
