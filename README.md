# uniWien_py.fin

This is a repo for all my assignments for the Python 1 course, taught by Christian Westheide


## The files

 - HW1_MoritzJakob: is a pure python file where I build and test most of the code that is required.
 - homework1.ipynb: is a Jupyter Notebook containing the homework assignment. This was downloaded from Moodle on Fri 10.Nov 07:39. I keep it here to have all of my stuff together.

## The not-yet-files

 - I want a LaTeX file that reviews the work and outputs from the assignment
 - I want a pure Python file (HW1_MoritzJakob, but proper and sorted) with the whole assignment. The outputs generated here should feed the LaTeX file.
 - Maybe the two steps above will be morphed into a single Jupyter Notebook, but that will be determined later on. There is also the possibility of just using homework1.ipynb and inserting the code cells here. We'll see.


REMEMBER: The name of the file that you upload should be named *Homework1_YourLastName_YourStudentID*.
